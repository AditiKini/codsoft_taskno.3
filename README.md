# codsoft_taskno.3


üìù Task Overview:

For Task 2, my objective was to build a machine-learning model that could classify different species of iris flowers based on their attributes. The dataset provided valuable information, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.



üí° Approach:

To tackle this challenging task, I followed a well-structured approach:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Exploration: I thoroughly explored the Iris flower dataset, gaining insights into the distribution and relationships between the features.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing: I performed essential data cleaning, and handled any missing values and outliers to make the data suitable for modeling.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Selection and Training: I experimented with various classification algorithms, including k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. I evaluated their performance using appropriate metrics and selected the most accurate model i.e. Logistic Regression.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation: To ensure the model's robustness, I validated it on a separate test dataset and calculated relevant evaluation metric such as accuracy.

üìä Results:

I am thrilled to report that my Iris Flower Classification model achieved outstanding accuracy, with 1.0 . The model demonstrated its capability to classify iris flowers accurately based on their attributes.
